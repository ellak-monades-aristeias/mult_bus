# mult_bus

This project contains the necessary source code and documentation in order to set up a multimedia center, which can be used inside a bus, in order to improve customer services. This system mainly uses (technological) devices such as monitors and speakers which exist in buses, which  after our system setup, passengers will be able to vote and play multimedia. They will connect to the system with their smart phones through wi-fi. In addition to that, the system will show the position of the bus on the Map, which will give opportunity to the passengers, and the people that wait for the bus to learn where the bus exactly is. 

# Software stack
